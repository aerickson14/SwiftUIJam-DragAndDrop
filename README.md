# SwiftUIJam Drag And Drop

Experimenting and playing around with drag and drop interactions in SwiftUI.

### File and Folder Example

Initially started out with a file/folder metaphor to get the initial implementation of drag and drop working.

### Drop Detection

Experimented with the ability to specify which objects can be dropped on which drop targets.

### Nested Containers

Trying something a bit more complex where draggable objects are contained within other draggable objects.

Tasks were kept track of during SwiftUI Jam using a [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/7SiisqL1/swiftuijam-draganddrop)
