# SwiftUIJam Drag And Drop

Experimenting and playing around with drag and drop interactions in SwiftUI.

### File and Folder Example

Initially started out with a file/folder metaphor to get the initial implementation of drag and drop working.

### Drop Detection

Experimented with the ability to specify which objects can be dropped on which drop targets.
